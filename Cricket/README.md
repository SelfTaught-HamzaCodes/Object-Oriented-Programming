## Cricket
Reminiscing about the past, I recall a **childhood game** I used to play with my friends: **Hand Cricket**!  

`Cricket.py` is a program that recreates this memory, allowing me to play this game with a computer that can make intelligent decisions based on how I, as a player, approach the game.

#### Functionality:
- Allows the player to choose their favorite team while matching them against a random team.
- Allows the player to configure settings from among the many available options.
- You will be matched against a computer that makes intelligent decisions.

#### What is Hand Cricket ?
Hand Cricket is a simple game where two players take turns batting and bowling. To dismiss the batsman, the number on the hand must be the same as the number chosen by the bowler; otherwise, it is counted as a run. Both the batsman and bowler must display a number between 1 and 6 using their fingers.

#### How to play ?
You can play this game using the `Cricket Game.exe` that is uploaded, along with the source code for the same application.
