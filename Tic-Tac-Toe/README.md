## Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players can choose to play against a friend or a computer with two difficulty levels (easy and hard).

#### Functionality:

- **Game Modes**: Players can choose between two game modes: playing against a friend (local multiplayer) or playing against the computer (AI).
- **Difficulty Levels**: When playing against the computer, players can select between two difficulty levels: easy and hard.
- **Turn-Based Play**: The game follows a turn-based format where players take alternating turns.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game checks for winning conditions, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matches, and declares a winner when appropriate.
- **Validation**: The program validates user inputs to ensure they are within the correct range and not already chosen.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks and displays the scores for both players and the number of drawn matches.
- **Continuation**: After each game, players have the option to continue playing or quit the game.

#### How to Play:

- Choose the game mode:
  - Enter '1' for playing against a friend (local multiplayer).
  - Enter '2' for playing against the computer.
    - If playing against the computer, select the difficulty level by entering '1' for easy or '2' for hard.
- The game starts with one player taking the first turn, and players alternate turns.
- To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the empty cell where you want to place your mark (either '0' or 'X').
- The game continues until a player wins, the game is drawn, or players choose to quit.
- After each game, the scores are displayed, and players can choose to continue playing or quit the game.

#### Note:

- The game provides an option to continue playing after each match, allowing for multiple rounds.
- The difficulty level "easy" for the computer AI makes random moves, while "hard" tries to win or block the player's winning moves.
- The game tracks and displays the scores for both players and the number of drawn matches.
- The code utilizes a simple text-based interface for gameplay.
- The game logic and UI are implemented in Python.
