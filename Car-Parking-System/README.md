## Car Parking System
A **Car Parking System** created in **Python**, focusing on working with **Databases** and **Object-oriented Programming**.

#### Functionality:
- Allows car entries, based on the number plate.
- Allow car removal, based on the number plate.
- Automatic database updates and calculations.

#### Usage:
*For ease of use the same database with fields already defined can be used, and have all three files in the same folder*
- Configure settings for your system, in `Car_Parking_System.py`:
  
  ```
  # Constants:
  BASE_FARE = 1
  INCREMENT_FARE = 0.50

  # In Hours:
  FREE_TIME = 3
  INCREMENT_TIME = 1

  CURRENCY = "$"
  DATABASE = "cars.db"
  ```
- Run program using `Car_Parking_System_Abstraction.py`, as it acts as a terminal-based console to enter / remove cars.

#### Principals explored:
- **Encapsulation**.
- **Abstraction**.
